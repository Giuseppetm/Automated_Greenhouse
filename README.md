# Automated Greenhouse
I spent more or less 1 month on this project, which I exhibited during my graduation oral exam in 2018. It was designed to provide an example of how a traditional greenhouse can be automated through the use of a microcontroller like Arduino.

The automated greenhouse has the following features:
- Manual mode;
- Automatic mode;

each selectable with a dedicated button.
Each user choice will be accompanied by an audio that describes the action being performed, playing it through a speaker.

Components i used for the project:
-	Arduino Mega 2560 R3;
-	Breadboard;
-	YL-38 Module for YL-69;
-	Earth humidity sensor (YL-69);
-	Air humidity and temperature sensor (DHT22);
-	3W Speaker;
-	Display LCD 1602A;
-	Audio module DF Player Mini SKU-DFR0299;
-	Micro SD;
-	Water pump DC30B;
-	Module for piloting the pump;
-	Tubes for passage of the water;
-	Standard buttons;
-	10k Potentiometer;
- 1k, 2k and 10k Resistances;
-	Capacitors;
-	Connection cables.
